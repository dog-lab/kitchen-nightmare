        <h2>tl;dr version</h2>
        <p>
            I know, I know...you're in a hurry and just want to grab something that might be close to what you want.
            The <a href="kitchen-nightmare-full.html">full width sample</a> uses the raw ultra-simple css file and
            places the customizations in the style section of the header. Combine the styles found in the header
            with the same ones in the css file and you're good to go. The <a href="kitchen-nightmare-centered.html">
            centered sample</a> of the menu has the same structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combining the styles should be easy since all classes of interest begin with ".megamenu". Anything
            beyond that involves the grid (see the <a href="https://github.com/dog-lab/naked-grid">
            naked-grid project</a>) or stuff entered as a demonstration, or example, of things you can do with the menu.
        </p>
        <p>And one more thing: No, it isn't responsive &ndash; yet!</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>kitchen-nightmare is released with two different layouts:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A menu stretching across 100% of its parent or container, and</li>
            <li>A menu centered in its parent or container</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The centered menu takes up the horizontal space used by the sum of the widths of the individual list item
            elements (&lt;li&gt;). Of course, you can also "pad out" the container to increase that width.
            The container, in this case, is the unordered list element (&lt;ul&gt;) that contains all of the
            top level &lt;li&gt; elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            This page discusses the generic structure of the menu and provides links to some simple examples of each
            layout. In any event, to keep things simple, the first layout (Full Mega Menu) is considered the
            default layout
        </p>
        <p>The menu has a simple structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A container &ndash; in the sample here, this is a simple div that can provide a background
            color, or in the case of the centered menu, a structure that centers the menu on the page.</li>
            <li>An unordered list container that contains the list of menu selections</li>
            <li>
                A list item for each menu selection that provides UI services via a link element
                (e.g. the ability to respond to a hover state), and finally
            </li>
            <li>
                A menu item container that houses the UI components associated with a menu item. This could
                be something like a list of links, a form, or any other specialized content applicable to
                the menu item.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The base kitchen-nightmare CSS used for this page is about as stripped down as I can make it. One custom
            setting, however, is padding added around the anchor elements embedded in the &lt;li&gt; elements at
            the top of the menu container. This allows for easier reading of the menu items displayed below. Since
            you will probably want to use your own sizing I moved that setting to the style section in the header
            of this page ( .megamenu > li > a { padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em; } ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Another blank css rule is found for ( megamenu > li > a:hover {} ). This allows you to highlight (or not)
            the current menu item background, its border, or whatever else you like. Examples of this are found in
            the provided example pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Full (100% Wide) Mega Menu</h2>
        <div class="col-1-1 megabar">
            <p>
                This layout, as suggested by the name, stretches horizontally across the screen (or across its
                container). The individual menu items are left aligned with the an option of right aligned
                items if required. The skeleton, or outline, of the elements involved in this menu is displayed
                below as a series of boxes outlined with red dots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mouse over each menu item and you can see a placeholder container that mirrors the menu item
                name followed by a "->" and the type of container connected to that menu item. For example,
                "Home" has a container with text that reads "Home -> Full Megabox." A Full Megabox extends from the
                far left to the end of the text, or the far right of the menu; whichever comes first.  The next entry
                is "Columns" and has a container with text reading "Columns -> Megabox." A megabox extends from the
                current column, "Columns" in this case, to the end of the text, or the far right of the menu; whichever
                comes first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="kitchen-nightmare-full.html">example</a> customizes the menu UI and adds some sample
                menu item data. The example page header contains all custom css properties in the style element of
                the header. This better demonstrates the changes relating to the UI vs the structure supporting
                menu layout. I suppose, if you wanted to glance at this sideways, you could say it's a separation
                of concerns: layout (structure) vs UI.

                <ul class="megamenu">
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Home</a>
                        <div class="full-megabox">
                            Home -> Full Megabox
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Columns</a>
                        <div class="megabox">
                            Columns -> Megabox

                        <div class="megabox">
                            Links -> Megabox
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Calendar</a>
                        <div class="full-megabox">
                            Calendar -> Full Megabox (stretched out to reach Calendar ListItem)
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Form</a>
                        <div class="megabox">
                            Form -> Megabox
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Right Aligned Menu Items</h3>
            <p>
                In some cases you might want a menu item pushed out to the right hand side of the screen
                (or right hand side of the menu container); pretty easy stuff to accomplish. Just add a CSS class
                to a (&lt;li&gt;) menu item for "float right" and place it at the end of your &lt;li&gt; menu item list.
                Immediately below is the same menu as above with an added &lt;li&gt; element pushed out to the right.
                For demonstration purposes, the CSS float property is added as an inline style to the &lt;li&gt;
                element (e.g. &lt;li style="float: right"&gt;).
            </p>
            <div class="megabar">
                <ul class="megamenu">

                            Right -> Megabox

        </div>

    <h2>Centered Mega Menu</h2>
    <p>
        As the name says, this layout creates a mega menu centered in its container. In this case, the menu is
        centered in a div that stretches horizontally across the screen. The div contains a text-align: center
        css property to center its contents. Additionally the &lt;ul&gt; mega menu element requires changing the
        display property to inline-block to effect the changes.
